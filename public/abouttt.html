    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>Founded in <span class="highlight">2023</span>, the <span class="highlight">IGNITE Dance Club</span> began as a small group of enthusiastic dancers who shared one dream — to express, perform, and inspire. What started as a handful of students now stands as one of the most <span class="highlight">energetic and creative communities</span> on campus, known for its passion and precision both on and off stage.</p>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>Our mission is simple — to <span class="highlight">ignite the spirit of dance</span> within every student. We believe dance is more than just movement; it's a language of emotion, confidence, and creativity. Through regular workshops, performances, and collaborations, IGNITE encourages members to grow as performers, choreographers, and leaders.</p>

    <h2>What We Do</h2>
    <p>IGNITE hosts a variety of <span class="highlight">events, showcases, and inter-college competitions</span> throughout the year. From freestyle battles and annual fests to themed performances, our dancers bring life to every occasion. We also conduct <span class="highlight">open workshops</span> for beginners and advanced sessions for dedicated performers.</p>

    <h2>Our Culture</h2>
    <p>More than just a club, IGNITE is a <span class="highlight">family</span>. We celebrate diversity in dance styles — be it hip-hop, contemporary,freestyle, classical, or fusion. Members support and challenge each other, creating a space where everyone can shine, experiment, and evolve. Every rehearsal, every beat, and every performance strengthens our bond and fuels our fire to keep dancing.</p>

    <h2>Join the Movement</h2>
    <p>Whether you’re a seasoned dancer or just beginning to find your rhythm, <span class="highlight">IGNITE welcomes you</span>. Bring your passion, your energy, and your unique style — and let’s make the stage come alive together.</p>
